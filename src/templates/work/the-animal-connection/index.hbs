                            I helped local San Francisco based pet store, <a href="https://www.animalconnectionsf.net/">The Animal Connection</a>, to create a design that they can use for stickers or as a branding logo.

                            Earlier this year, I designed a sticker for a local dog event, Dogs and Die, where I got into contact with the owner of The Animal Connection, who was impressed with my design and asked if I could whip something up for their store. I approached that design somewhat casually, and felt I had creative freedom, since I did it willingly on my own time. But with The Animal Connection, I knew I wanted to approach it with a plan of attack.

                            I wanted to create something that would embody the brand and could capture the essence of The Animal Connection. To do so, I did a quick brainstorming exercise to see what I could come up with.

                            The Animal Connection prides themselves on being the largest, independent pet store in San Francisco, so I came up with words like "personal", "unique", and "success", and things like the "Golden Gate Bridge" to represent San Francisco. "Pets" could be associated with "animals", "companions", or  "friends." Then I realized, the best idea was to simply showcase pets, and I chose my top 3 picks: dogs, cats, and birds.

                        <p class="reader">
                            Still, I wanted to incorporate the idea of being personable and providing a service that's unique to the store that you can't find anywhere else in the city. I liked the idea of a circle sticker, representing a well-rounded, encapsulating brand. The Animal Connection also wanted a retro feel, also going back to the idea of being a personal brand.

                            I browsed Dribbble for some pet and retro designs for some inspiration and simply picked what I liked. I think what I collected gave me a good point of reference to begin the next step and start sketching.

                            This part was fun, something I don't get to do everyday. Tried many different things, but eventually asked myself, "what's the simplest way I can draw a cat?" I liked how it looked and tried to do the dog and liked that one too.

                        After tracing my cat and dog with Illustrator, I added a bird and wrapped everything in a circle. I used the Google font, Karla for the text. I remember the owner of The Animal Connection mentioning an affinity for space and astronauts so I figured painting a starry night would be a good way to fill the empty space above the pets. I used the same green in the current logo to give the entire sticker some color, and used white to accent the details.
