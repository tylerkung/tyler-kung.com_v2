                        <p class="reader">Currently, I'm based in San Francisco, CA as a digital developer for HDMZ, a full service digital marketing agency. I've managed and executed multiple web projects as the primary front-end developer and have helped clients bring their ideas to life. At HDMZ, I've worked with clients and projects of all sizes and have grown to understand the creative and digital process of building a website.
                        </p>
                        <p class="reader">Creatively, I'm pushing myself to constantly create things. I've always liked drawing and doodling growing up, and I think those skills have helped me develop creative skills in a digital space. Whether it's website designs, stickers, or whatever it may be, I enjoy the creative process and time spent not looking at code. ðŸ™‚

                        <p class="reader">In my free time, I love traveling or getting some buddies together to play basketball or grab beers. Trying my best to cut down on my daily screen time, but I'll make an occassional exception for a couple of hours of video games.
